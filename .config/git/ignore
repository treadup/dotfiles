# If you want to ignore files in a git project locally then you can
# use the .git/info/exclude file. This file follows the same syntax as
# a .gitignore file. This file is never checked into the repo. This means
# that the rules specified in the .git/info/exclude file will only have
# an effect locally and never on the remote repo.
